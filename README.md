# UNO
 Identifying an UNO card using Computer Vision and Machine Learning

Steps:
1. Make sure to install all required libraries (e.g os, cv2, matplotlib, glob, numpy)
2. Open card_recognition and run. This code compares the captured image in a video to match in the dataset.
3. Open Number_recognition and run. This allows an input card to brute force match within the dataset and output the result.


Limitations:
1. Not very accurate reading of the object in video
2. Have to use brute force matching
